## CORS - Demo
- Cross Origin Resource Sharing
- allow code that is stored in one S3 to be accessed and used by code in another bucket
- you can allow your S3 bucket to host a static URL website
  - this will generate a bucket website endpoint
  - when you go to configure CORS, you will need to configure it with this endpoint

## S3
- Simple, Storage, Service
- provides secure, durable, highly scalable object storage
  - object storage = for files, webpages, images, etc.
- simple and easy to use
- very scalable at a low cost

### Object Based Storage
- manages data as objects, rather than in a file system or data blocks
- upload any type of file you can think of
  - photos, videos, code, documents, text files, etc.
- CANNOT be used to run an OS or DB

### S3 Basics
- unlimited storage: total volume of data and number of objects stored is unlimited
- objects max size is 5TB
- store files in "buckets" (similar to folders)

### Working with S3 Buckets
- universal namespace (all AWS accounts share the S3 namespace)
  - each S3 bucket name is globally unique (no region / AZ)
- S3 object URLs: `https://bucket-name.s3.Region.amazonaws.com/key-name`
- uploading files: when you upload a file to S3, you will receive an HTTP 200 code if upload was successful 

### S3 as a Key-Value Store
- each object contains a key and a value
  - key = name of the object (ex. photo.jpg)
  - value = the data itself, which is made up of a sequence of bytes
  - version ID = important for storing multiple versions of the same object (key)
  - metadata = data about the data you are storing (ex. content-type, last-modified, etc.)

### S3 is Highly Available and Highly Durable
- data is spread across multiple devices and facilities to ensure availability and durability 
- built for 99.95% - 99.99% service availability depending on S3 tiers
- designed for (11 9's) durability for data stored in S3

### S3 Characteristics
- tiered storage: S3 offers a range of storage classes for different use cases
- lifecycle management: define rules to automatically transition objects to a cheaper storage tier (or delete) after a set period of time
- versioning: all versions of an object can be stored and retrieve (including deleted objects)

### S3 Security
- can enable Server-Side Encryption: default encryption on a bucket to encrypt all objects store within
- Access Control Lists (ACLs): define which AWS accounts or groups are granted access and what type of access 
  - can assign S3 ACLs to individual objects within a bucket
- Bucket Policies: S3 bucket policies specify what actions are allowed or denied
  - ex. allow user Alice to PUT but not DELETE objects in the bucket

## Exam Tips
- S3 is object-based; allows you to upload files
- Not OS or DB storage suitable 
- files can have a max size of 5TB and a min size of 0 bytes
- unlimited storage available (total volume and number of stored items)
- files stored in buckets in a universal namespace
- successful CPI or API uploads will generate a 200 OK code
- S3 Objects
  - key = object name
  - value = data itself stored in sequence of bytes
  - version ID = allow storage of multiple versions of same object
  - metadata = data about data stored (content-type, last-updated, etc.)

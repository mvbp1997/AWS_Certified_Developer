## API Gateway Advanced Functions
### Importing APIs to API Gateway
- you can import API definition files to import an API
- do this through the "Import API" feature
- supported protocols: OpenAPI (Swagger)
  - industry standard to define RESTful APIs
- you can use OpenAPI definition file to create a new API or update an existing API

### Legacy Protocols
- SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) which returns a response in XML format instead of JSON
  - you can configure API Gateway as a SOAP web service passthrough
  - you can also use API Gateway to transform XML response into JSON

## Exam Tips: Advanced API Gateway
- you can import APIs using external definitions files, ex. OpenAPI (Swagger)
- when dealing with legacy applications which use SOAP, you can configure API Gateway as a SOAP web service passthrough, or you can use API Gateway to convert the XML response to JSON

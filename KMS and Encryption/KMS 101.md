## KMS 101
- Key Management Service
- managed service that helps you create and control the encryption keys used to encrypt your data
- completely integrated with AWS services
- as easy as "checking a box" in console to activate/encrypt data

### When to use KMS
- use whenever you are dealing with sensitive information
  - ex. customer data, financial data, database passwords, secrets, credentials, etc.

### KMS Integration with AWS
S3, DynamoDB, RDS, Lambda (encrypt and decrypt data), EBS, EFS, CloudTrail (audit trail of API calls into KMS), Developer Tools

### CMK ?
- Customer Master Key: capable of encrypting and decrypting data up to 4MB
- used to generate/encrypt/and decrypt the Data Key
- use the Data Key to encrypt/decrypt data
- this is known as Envelope Encryption: using a Master Key to decrypt/encrypt other keys that you will use to encrypt/decrypt data

## CMK Demo
In IAM
- create group with admin privileges
- create user (key manager) and add them to group
- create user (key user) and add them to group
In KMS
- create new key
- NOTE: KMS is region based (keys created will be isolated to their regions)
- symmetric: one encryption key for both encrypt and decrypt operations
  - all encrypt/decrypt operations must be done by a user with the proper IAM permissions for KMS
- asymmetric: public and private key pair that can be used for encrypt/decrypt or sign/verify operations 
  - if you need to encrypt/decrypt outside the realm of AWS, you can use this method with the public key
- Key Material Origin: cryptographic secrets origin which make up the key
- you can create and use aliases to reference your key
- choose key administrators: who do we want to administer the key using the KMS API
- key usage permissions: who do we want to use the key to encrypt/decrypt
- key policy: resource based policy
- CMKs don't delete automatically, they are scheduled for delete (1 week grace period)

### CMK Summary
- CMK = Customer Master Key
- your application can use an alias to refer to the CMK
- CMK has a creation date 
- CMK can also have a description
- CMKs also have a key state: enabled, disabled, pending deletion, unavailable
- you can provide a key-material or use the AWS-provided one
- CMKs always stays within KMS

## Exam Tips: KMS
- set up CMK:
  - create alias and a description, then select the key-material (self provided or AWS, CloudHSM)
- key administrative permissions:
  - IAM users and roles that can administer (but not use) the key through the KMS API 
  - actions such as: list, add, delete, enabled, disabled, etc.
  - lifecycle management
- key usage permissions:
  - IAM users and roles that can use the key to encrypt and decrypt data
- "AWS managed key" = AWS-managed CMK
  - AWS provides managed CMK keys used on your behalf with other AWS services
- Customer-Managed CMK = you create, own and manage yourself 
- Data Key = encryption key that you can use to encrypt data, including large amounts of data
  - you can use your CMK to generate, encrypt and decrypt data keys
